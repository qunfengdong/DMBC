Description: This package implements the machine-learning method described by Gao et al (2016) for microbiome classification using a Bayes classifier based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution.  In addition to classification, the package also identifies a subset of microbial taxa that can achieve the maximum classification accuracy.
  12/11/2018	v1.1.0 has the following updates:	1) Relative abaundance table is used as input. 2) Variable "Others", which is the sum of all the variables except for the selected features, is not considered as a feature in this version. 3) Ten fold validation function is temporarily disabled. 4) Pi score instead of the wilcoxon p value is used to rank the importantce of features (Xiao Y, Hsiao TH, Suresh U, et al. A novel significance score for gene selection and ranking. Bioinformatics. 2012;30(6):801-7. )
