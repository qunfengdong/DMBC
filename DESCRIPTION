Description: This package implements the machine-learning method described by Gao et al (2016) for microbiome classification using a Bayes classifier based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution.  In addition to classification, the package also identifies a subset of microbial taxa that can achieve the maximum classification accuracy.
  The updates includes: 1) The Input format now is that the data column is the relative abundance of the bacteria, instead of the abosulte count table.
                        2) Sum of Other features is not used as a feature.
                        3) The most important improvement is using the Pi score instead of the wilcoxon P value in FS.r funciton to rank the importances of the features.(Xiao Y, Hsiao TH, Suresh U, et al. A novel significance score for gene selection and ranking. Bioinformatics. 2012;30(6):801-7. )
