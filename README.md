Dirichlet-Multinomial Bayes Classifier (DMBC) for Microbiome Classification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package implements the machine-learning method described by Gao et al (2016) for microbiome classification using a Bayes classifier based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution.  In addition to classification, the package also identifies a subset of microbial taxa that can achieve the maximum classification accuracy.

## Update
* 3/7/2018	v0.2.0	Add ten-fold cross-validation function in addition to the existing leave-one-out cross-validation function
* 3/12/2018	v0.2.1	Increase consistency of feature selection.

## Installation

Please make sure you have devtools installed in your R and do the following:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("qunfengdong/DMBC")
```

## Usage

There are totally 6 functions included in the package. The most important one is dmbc_predict, which will predict probability for a test set from DMBC model given a training set.

* best_cm	: Confusion Matrix for the Best Model
* CalPrb	: Calculate Likelihood based on Dirichlet-multinomial distribution estimated parameters
* Cal_AUC	: Calculate Area Under the ROC Curve from Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
* dmbc_predict	: Predict probability from DMBC model 
* FS	: Filter and Feature Selection based on Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test
* loocv	: Leave-one-out cross-validation
* tfcv	: Ten-fold cross-validation
* test	: Example Testing Data
* training	: Example Training Data
